/*
 POLICY
 * only ASCII characters are legal in the input
 [entertaining option: extend IDs to accept alphanumeric-like characters from other languages in UNICODE].
 No other characters are allowed.
 * the language is CASE-SENSITIVE: "if" "IF" "If" and "iF" are four different things.  Three of them are IDs. "if" is a keyword.
 * keywords are in LOWER CASE.
 * a couple of keywords are there for possible future extensions,
 * COMMENT: from "***" to the end of the current line.  Does not matter what else is on the line.
 * WS (white space): any sequence of space, tabs, formfeeds etc are ignores
 * END-OF-LINE: ignored, but counted
 * better write code can deal with all END-OF-LINE (CR on old Macs, NL on Unix/Linux/Mac OS, CR LN on Windows)

/*
 FUNCTION REQUIREMNT FOR SCANNER
 -- count lines
 -- count character positions
 -- store with every token the string it corresponds to in the program text, with line number and starting and ending character positions
 -- be able to read a file for input, or standard input
 -- each time there is a problem, it has to output the line number, character positions (start and finish) of the problem
 -- be uncrashable: whatever the input, it should process it, generate reasonable tokens if it find them, generate errors/warnings otherwise, and do not quit until input is exhausted
 
 -- your scanner should be initialized by giving it a source of input (say, an input stream "cin" / "stdin" or an opened file name)
 -- it must support the operation next() which returns the next token and advances the scanner
 -- it must support the operation peek() which shows the next token but does NOT advance the scanner
 -- it's not clear if we need an operation unput() or backup() which puts a token back into the buffer.  hopefully not.
